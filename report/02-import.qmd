## Import

For this project, I focused on analyzing the men’s singles matches that Chou Tien‐Chen played between 2018 and 2021 in various tournaments. The ShuttleSet dataset is organized hierarchically where each match is stored in its own folder and within each match folder are separate CSV files for set 1, set 2, set 3. The set level files contain stroke‐level data. 

In addition, the homography.csv maps pixel coordinates from each match video to actual court coordinates and the match.csv provides metadata such as match ID, duration, and round.

All files are publicly available through the ShuttleSet GitHub repository. To prepare the data for analysis, I downloaded the complete dataset ZIP from the GitHub repository, copied the relevant match folders along with the `homography.csv` and `match.csv` files and added them into my R project.
