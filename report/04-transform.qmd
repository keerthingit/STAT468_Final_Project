## Transform

I created a set-level summary table by extracting the final stroke of each set, recording the set winner and the final scores for both Chou and his opponent. This served both as a quick reference for performance summaries and as a check that the match flow data matched the recorded results.  

I joined in the relevant match metadata so that each stroke carried information about the tournament, round, year, and opponent. I then grouped the data by match, set, and rally, filtering it down to just the final stroke in each rally. These final strokes were of particular interest because they directly determined rally outcomes.  

For each rally-ending shot, I coded key variables as factors with meaningful levels and orders. The outcome variable `chou_win` was defined as a binary factor (“win” or “loss”), rounds were ordered from “Group-Stage” through to “Finals,” and the rally phase factor retained its early to mid to late ordering. Shot types, (forehand/backhand), set number, and opponent identity were also converted to factors for consistency. I filtered the data further so that it only contained rallies where Chou was the player executing the final stroke so the features would be defined from his perspective.

I calculated the Euclidean distance between Chou and his opponent at the final stroke. This distance provided a measure of their relative positioning. I computed the unit vector from Chou to his opponent. These vectors formed the basis for a coordinate system anchored to the opponent’s position relative to Chou.  

Using this coordinate system, I then calculated the Euclidean distance between Chou and the shuttle, followed by the shuttle’s parallel and perpendicular positions relative to the Chou–opponent line. This transformation allowed me to represent shuttle placement not just in raw court coordinates but in a way that was interpretable in the tactical context of each rally.
